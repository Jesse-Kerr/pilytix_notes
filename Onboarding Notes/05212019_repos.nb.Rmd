What if you have a general data wrangling procedure, that works for all your projects, but you need it customized for different variants? 
In other words, this procedure basically applies to all of your projects, but it is somewhat different, small things you want to change?

You make an s3 object that defines your project. 

```{r}
create_project <- function(project_name, options){
    project <- structure(
        list(
            project_name = project_name,
               
            # Note that you can wrap all project 
            # specific params into an options list 
            # and unpack it later in the S3 methods.
        	options = options
        ),
      
        # class name is simply the project_name, you 
        # can also assign additonal parent classes to
        # set up an inheritance structure, which is 
        # particularly useful if you have layers of 
        # projects that follow one generic procedure
       
        # E.g., class = c(project_name, "my_project")
        # all projects are also "my_project"
        class = project_name
    )
    return(project)
}

```
